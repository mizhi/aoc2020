Hi, if you're reading this, you've probably come here from my twitter posts for
this year. Some context...

I just discovered Advent of Code this year and decided that it would be a great
way to get some reps in on coding.

These past few years I've worked primarily in Ruby, which is a wonderful
language and I enjoy it immensely. But I have also done professional work in
Python, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, Perl, C#, and Matlab (if you count
research). And I enjoy experimenting with different languages so I've been
playing with Go, Elixir, Io, and Scheme. I like the different ways that
languages vector your thought when solving problems.

Additionally, I've been primarily managing engineers and leading teams the past
couple of years, so my hands on code time has been diminished. This feels like a
fun and structured way to flex some muscles and maintain technical chops.

My intent is to use a different language each day, maybe revisit previous days
in a different language, and to try different ways to solve the puzzles. I don't
consider myself a great programmer, but I do alright. If you find some of my
solutions useful or learn something from them, then all the better. If you've
got any suggestions to improve them, then by all means, make an issue on the
project and let's talk.

Happy Holidays!
